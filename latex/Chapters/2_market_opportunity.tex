\vspace{-0.15cm}
Our business model changes after reaching series B/C. We first build a database of task- \& solution pairs as consultants. Upon acquiring sufficient data, we intend to pivot to a TTD market making using an arbitrage bot built on that dataset.

\noindent The logistics market is good starting point due our affinity with its algorithmic and efficiency driven nature. Our top-down market analysis contains a Monte-Carlo simulation of the total addressable market size for the TruCol company. This TAM yields an estimated yearly revenue of 600K to 14M per year.
