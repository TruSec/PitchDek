Companies put a decoy of their software stack(s) in a decentralised virtual machine, stake its security, and set their desired responsible disclosure period(RDP). Hackes see this software and stake. If they find an exploit, they put it in a decentralised locker and pay for evaluation. Companies see the exploit and patch their systems within the RDP. After the RDP, the locker opens up, the exploit is validated, the hacker receives payout and the company can re-stake their updated stack.
