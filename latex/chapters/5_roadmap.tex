\section{Roadmap}
\vspace{-0.15cm}
To develop a proof of concept, we would like to reach out to hospitals, financial institutes and large IT enterprises (e.g. Microsoft etc.) to ask them for their requirements on a protocol implementation, then raise funding, and develop an iteratative MWE. After sponsoring hacks on the protocol (and on the deployed stacks), we aim to re-evaluate stakeholder needs and feasibility. Based on that, we aim to raise more funding and transition towards production-ready protocol deployment.
